# SecureKali

SecureKali is an semi-automated tool to secure your freshly installed Kali OS.

Using a fresh Kali behind a NAT for practising pentesting exercises and challenges gives a low security risk.
But when using Kali as a real-time pentesting tool, it is wise to tweak it and makes sure you are ready for the challenge.

This script will tighten security on your Kali host, it will install common security tools and add well-known wordlists.
